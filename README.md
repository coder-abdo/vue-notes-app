# vue-notes-app

This is a simple note application build in top of `vue-3` with `composition` API.I used my experience in `React` to build this application and here what I learnt so far:

1. split app into smaller components.
2. uplifiting the `state` up to the top parent component.
3. how to use conditions and loops.
4. passing `state` to childern using props.
5. passing handlers to children using `$emit` handler.

## What Should I Focus Next in `Vue`:

1. using Typescript.
2. using State Managment tool `Vuex` & `Pinia`.
3. build large applications.
4. using `Nuxt`.

## My Tools:

1. `ChadNvim`.
2. `Bun` Runtime.
